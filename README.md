# Motivation

Iâ€™m a big fan of quizzes and puzzles and have a passion for neuroscience. I like to keep my prefrontal cortex and hippocampus active and engaged by playing these quizzes and solving puzzles, whether online or offline. One morning during the lockdown, Wordle was launched, and I got hooked. Now, I solve (or attempt to solve) Wordle every morning.
